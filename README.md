# 90B-Shall-Statements

This repository contains a draft for the spreadsheet the CMVP will use to identify the status of the requirements to SP 800-90B, and IGs 7.18, 7.19, and 7.20. Please review the spreadsheet and provide any feedback in the form of issues on this repository by July 12, 2021. When making an issue about a specific requirement, use the associated ID column so others can know what specifically is being addressed. After July 12, 2021, the CMVP will review the issues and discussions to arrive at a finalized version of the spreadsheet. It will be published on CSRC, and the CST labs notified. 

If you would prefer to keep comments anonymous, feel free to email them to christopher.celi (at) nist.gov. Only with your permission will a summary of the comment go to the discussion board. CMVP would prefer comments be public to understand the consensus of the industry and labs. If you agree with a discussion item raised by someone else, you are encouraged to "thumbs-up" the comment. 

NOTE: This spreadsheet is hosted for discussion purposes only. Any and all guidance on cryptographic module validations should come from the NIST or CCCS CMVP.
